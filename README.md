!here command

Plugin for (https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper).

The command '!here' will display your coordinate and dimension to the entire server. In addition, your overworld coordinate will be converted into nether coordinates and displayed as well.

This is heavily influenced by the plugin that TIS Trinity Union uses for MCDR.
